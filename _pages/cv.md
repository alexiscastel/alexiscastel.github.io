Work experience
======
* 2022-present: Technical Expert Aerospace Vibro-Acoustics - <i>ESI North America | Farmington Hills, MI, USA</i>
  * Provides technical expertise for vibro-acoustic simulations for aerospace applications. Activities focused on customer specific projects, presales studies and training development.
  * Takes part in engineering software development planning sessions ensuring customer feedback is accounted for. Participates in developing feature acceptance criteria.
  * Management and technical coaching of a team of three application engineers.
  * Methodology development:
  * Simulation resource and time requirement prediction based on large data sets of previous models solve log using Bayesian regressions.
    * Development of a Bayesian optimization for rapid probabilistic estimations of overall level on frequency response coupled finite element-boundary element models.
    * Shock simulation using the virtual mode synthesis and the finite element method (implicit and explicit transient formulations).
    * Damping projection models using the modal strain energy.
  * Feature prototyping using the Python environment as part of the methodology development, allowing for early acceptance from the customer before feature development
