I decided to print a nice looking pair of speakers from [Thingiverse.com](https://www.thingiverse.com/), specifically [this model](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4750820). I was really curious of how this would perform and mainly if the designer focused only on looks or if there was some real acoustic engineering behind it. So I built it:

Choosing first an experimental approach, I decided to measure (with AudioTool on my phone), the response of those speakers to a pink noise:

I thought this was pretty good! Luck of the draw or proper engineering, the next step for me was simulating the speakers with VA One using a coupled Finite Element Model/Boundary Element model.
