LuaILS is a custom Lua script designed to enhance the experience of flying RC aircraft by providing GPS telemetry data and feedback for safer, more precise landings. This project originated from personal challenges in aligning RC planes with runways and avoiding obstacles like trees during landing. To address these difficulties, LuaILS integrates GPS data into a telemetry screen and offers audio cues when the aircraft is correctly lined up with the runway.

The repository is located [here](https://github.com/alexiscastel/LuaILS).

## Features

    Telemetry Display: A clear visual representation of the aircraft's position relative to the landing strip.
    Audio Feedback: Real-time audio notifications to confirm proper alignment with the runway.
    Compatibility: Designed for use with GPS-enabled RC aircraft, such as the Turbo Timber Evolution.

## Current Limitations

    The GPS coordinates of the landing strip are currently hardcoded, which makes it less flexible for use in varying locations.
