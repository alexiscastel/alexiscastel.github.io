To account for structural damping, modal frequency response simulations typically define damping as the imaginary part of the stiffness matrix projected onto the modal basis. Three main damping distribution formulations are available in commercial codes. Each has damping definition limitations either in terms of frequency dependence or spatial uniformity, or accuracy limitations when looking at hyper-localized damping or subsystems with low modal densities. This paper presents an adapted damping distribution formulation implementation based on modal strain energy distribution between subsystems which lifts the restrictions present in the currently available formulations. First, a review of the existing damping distribution formulations is presented, detailing the limits of each one. Then the strain energy-based modal damping distribution is introduced and finally, a validation study on a generic payload is performed, illustrating the advantages of this new formulation.
