Optimizing noise control treatments in the early design phase is crucial to meet new strict regulations for exterior vehicle noise. Contribution analysis of the different sources to the exterior acoustic performance plays an important role in prioritizing design changes. A method to predict Pass-by noise performance of a car, based on source-path-receiver approach, combining data coming from simulation and experimental campaigns, is presented along with its validation. With this method the effect of trim and sound package on exterior noise can be predicted and optimized.
