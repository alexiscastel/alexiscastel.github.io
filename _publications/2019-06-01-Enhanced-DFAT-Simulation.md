While simulating complex acoustic environments such as Direct Field Acoustic Tests ® (DFAT®), initial simulation algorithms did not offer the flexibility to prioritize acoustic levels vs. ensuring diffusivity. However, when performing a correlation study, amplitude at given microphones is often prioritized vs diffusivity. This paper introduces a new optimization algorithm allowing the prioritization of level vs diffusivity. General concepts and link to the previous method is presented. This new implementation is then used to perform a correlation study against test data on a flight article. Measured sound pressure levels from both control and monitor microphones as well as structural responses are compared to simulation noting the similarities and remaining differences between physical and virtual tests. Validated simulation models are then used to evaluate the influence of the test room ceiling on the DFAT microphone.
