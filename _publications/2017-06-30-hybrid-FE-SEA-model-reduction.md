Innovative Hybrid FE- SEA modeling methods allow stiff structures modeled with finite elements to be coupled directly to more flexible SEA (Statistical Energy Analysis) structures in a combined model. This allows for a reduction of overall model computational time while preserving detail in areas where it is most needed. This case study presents a launch vehicle where a very stiff section was modeled with FE to preserve the critical response information in this section. A method to reduce the SEA structure in the model to just the locally connected structures was implemented, taking advantage of high-frequency responses being highly localized. With this reduced modeling method, comparisons to the full vehicle model show that the result retains its accuracy with only a small part of the total vehicle being modeled.
