This paper presents an explicit finite element simulation model designed to analyze the behavior of structures under shock loads, including composite materials. The study introduces a methodology to precisely account for frictional losses at mechanical interfaces within the structure. Additionally, to illustrate the importance of friction, material damping is purposefully removed from the model. By accurately modeling friction, the simulation provides detailed insights into shock response dynamics and where non-linear dissipation occurs. Additionally, the model incorporates a standard failure criterion to evaluate the risk of composite fracture under extreme loading conditions. These findings contribute to the design and qualification assessment of aerospace components, offering a predictive framework ultimately reducing failure risks present in shock qualification testing.
