Exterior vehicle noise is increasingly regulated and stricter requirements require optimization at an earlier design phase and attention to component-level target setting. Combining key simulated transfer functions with measured sources from component-level testing can be used for early-phase exterior noise predictions and to complement testing, especially indoor tests, at later stages of design. The effect of trim and sound package on exterior noise can be predicted with this approach. A validation case is presented along with capabilities and limitations of some proposed simulation methods and some recommended next steps for improvement of accuracy and process.
